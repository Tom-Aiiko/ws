		<h1>Thomas Csigai</h1>
		<h3>Game Developer</h3>
		<p>I'm a software engineer, and my most recent work has been deeply entrenched in the world of 3D game development using Unity. My fluency extends through Unity and C#, crafting immersive experiences that leverage the full potential of AR/VR development. This expertise has allowed me to push the boundaries of what's possible in game design, creating engaging and interactive worlds that captivate users and bring stories to life. Working with advanced graphics, physics, and AI within Unity, I've developed games that are not only fun to play but also technologically innovative.

Coming from a solid foundation with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science, my academic background provided me with the theoretical knowledge essential for problem-solving and software development. However, my passion has always been centered around gaming and the endless possibilities within virtual and augmented realities. This led me to pursue further specialization in Unity, Game, and AR/VR development. Joining Holberton was a strategic decision to deepen my expertise in these areas, driven by their hands-on approach and focus on real-world projects. An achievement that marked my journey was leading a project that won a notable award in a competitive gaming hackathon, showcasing my ability to innovate and execute complex game designs.

What motivates me is my passion for gamingâ€”not just as entertainment but as a powerful medium for storytelling, learning, and connection. This passion drives me to constantly explore new technologies and creative concepts, striving to create games that leave a lasting impact. In a team setting, I bring not only technical skills but also a collaborative spirit and a drive to inspire innovation. By fostering an environment of creativity and open communication, I can help propel a team towards achieving its goals and pushing the envelope in game development. My ambition is to contribute to projects that are not only technologically advanced but also meaningful and engaging for users, creating memorable experiences that resonate well beyond the screen.
